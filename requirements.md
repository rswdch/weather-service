# Weather Service API Requirements Document

## Overview

The Weather Service API is designed to provide weather information based on latitude and longitude coordinates. The API fetches data from the OpenWeather API and returns the weather condition, temperature classification (hot, cold, moderate), and any active weather alerts for the specified location.

## Key Functional Requirements
- Users should be able to retrieve the current weather conditions given a set of latitude and longitude coordinates.

## Key Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The API should respond within 5 seconds under normal load conditions.
- **Scalability:** The API should only need to handle a single user but should be able to scale in future development.
- **Availability:** The API should be available 
- **Capacity:** The API is stateless and does not store any request or response data.

### Security Requirements

- **API Key Management:** The API key for accessing the OpenWeather API should be securely stored and not exposed publicly.
- **Rate Limiting:** Rate limiting should be implemented on any public deployment to prevent abuse of the API. However, rate limiting will not be needed on a private, local deployment of the API.
- **Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize input parameters to prevent injection attacks.

### Development and Testing

- **Unit Tests:** Implement unit tests for key functionalities using a testing framework like Mocha or Jest.
- **Integration Tests:** TBD
- **Load Testing:** No load testing will be performed as the number of active users will be <10.
